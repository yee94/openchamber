# Session Sidebar Documentation

## Refactor result

- `SessionSidebar.tsx` now acts mainly as orchestration; core logic moved to focused hooks/components.
- Sidebar is now a single multi-project tree: an optional `pinned` top section,
  then projects, then worktrees/archived groups, then sessions. Pinned sessions
  render only in the top section and are excluded from project groups.
  Parent/child attachment always runs on the full session list first; pinned
  roots are omitted from project groups only after children attach. Pinned rows
  stay flat (no expand chevron, no nested subagents). Children of pinned parents
  stay hidden only while the parent is pinned; unpinning restores the normal
  parent/child tree under Projects.
- The Pinned section renders every pinned session and supports header collapse.
   Expanded project/worktree
   groups reveal 3 sessions by default from the already-fetched 20-session page;
   Show more reveals cached rows before loading the next 20-session page on demand.
   Once expanded past the default page, Show fewer is available alongside Show more
   so the list can fold back without loading every remaining row first. Busy and
   retrying sessions from the loaded snapshot remain visible beyond the folded boundary.
- Project/worktree Show more first reveals already-fetched rows, then fetches the next 20-session page for its own directory at the local boundary.
- The mobile session tree shows 20 root sessions by default for projects without worktrees. Projects with worktrees show 5 sessions per root/worktree bucket by default; Show more and Show fewer use that bucket's default page size. Collapsing and reopening a project or worktree preserves its revealed session count until Show fewer is selected or the sessions surface closes.
- Mobile project, worktree, and session rows expose their matching sidebar actions through a touch-sized bottom action panel after a 500ms long press. Scrolling movement and pointer cancellation abort the gesture, and the triggering click is consumed. Dedicated mobile and the responsive Web sessions sheet share the same hold controller; Web session rows retain their desktop context menu, while project and worktree context menus open the touch action panel.
- Project rows retain the persisted project-registry order while session and worktree data hydrates. A successfully sent message promotes its owning project to the top; ordinary activity and selection do not reorder the structural project tree.
- The Projects section header no longer shows a global syncing accessory. While a
  project's session directories are fetching, that project's folder icon swaps to a
  spinner. The expanded body shows localized "Loading sessions…" only when there is
  no usable snapshot; background refresh keeps the existing rows visible.
- Runtime session index cold start first hydrates the local SQLite session-summary index, then
  asks the runtime-owned Web Server to refresh the newest 20 root sessions for
  every persisted project root and known worktree directory. The browser never
  fans out project `session.list` calls. The server uses one preemptible background
  lane; selected-session detail/message/children requests abort that lane, run
  first, and let the directory resume afterward. Git/worktree discovery is not
  part of session startup. Archived sessions remain a separate lazy path.

  When the session-index API is unavailable (501), the coordinator falls back to
  the existing SDK-backed global session list.
- Cached starts use OpenCode's `start` timestamp filter and merge only sessions
  changed since the last successful sync. SQLite separately tracks the last
  incremental and last full reconciliation times; a full newest-20 pass runs at
  most once per 24 hours to remove sessions deleted or archived while the app
  was closed.
- `SessionStartupCoordinator` owns that pass before `SessionSidebar` mounts its
  normal orchestration. It waits for registered settings hydration and then reads
  the latest persisted project paths so an initially empty renderer store cannot
  release the startup barrier early. After starting the server job, the UI observes SQLite
  revisions through one low-priority long poll. When SQLite has rows the startup
  logo releases immediately only when those rows existed in the initial restore;
  validation then continues with cached rows visible.
  A first run with an empty index stays in the global loading state until the
  server job completes; sidebar code must not start another hydrate or list cycle.
- Project collapse state controls presentation only; Electron session-summary
  refresh targets come from the persisted project index, so no collapse/re-expand
  gesture is required to make a project appear.
- Renderer-level worktree catalog reconciliation runs after event-stream ready,
  topology changes, and deduplicated unknown session directories. The sidebar
  consumes that catalog and retains `oc.worktreeMap` as its cold-start snapshot.
- Each project menu provides a session-sync action. It refreshes the project's
  root and known worktree directories through the Electron server-owned index
  queue, while Web and VS Code use the bounded SDK refresh fallback.
- The native tray consumes the sidebar/global cache and lightweight global status; it does not trigger a delayed all-project session-list fanout.
- Mounting active or archived session rows creates only lightweight child-store
  subscriptions (`bootstrap: false`). Routed live status/permission events still
  update those rows, while config/path/session bootstrap remains owned by the
  active chat instead of fanning out across every visible sidebar directory.
  Selecting a session never fetches its children; child sessions are loaded only
  when the user expands the parent tree control.
- Tray status is event-first. Its startup/reconnect compensation waits for an
  established OpenCode connection, coalesces overlapping refreshes, and queries
  at most two directories concurrently; the 30-second poll is only a missed-event
  safety net.
- An idle global-session store always triggers a priority refresh, including after a runtime endpoint reset; the status therefore cannot remain idle after the sidebar's one-time mount effect has already run.
- `NavRail` is no longer part of sidebar/navigation flow.
- Project headers now own root sessions directly; there is no separate rendered `project root` subgroup.
- Active/hover rows use Codex-style inset neutral chips (`SIDEBAR_ROW_*`); light mode
  uses a soft wash (hover ~3.5%, active ~6%) so cream themes stay airy, while dark keeps
  a slightly deeper wash (hover 8%, active 11%) so the two states still read apart. Nested
  rows indent via padding *inside* the chip so hover/active wash stays full-width
  (reserved left gutter). Depth 1
  uses the folder icon column (`16 + 6`) so all project sessions share one vertical line under the
  parent folder *name*. Deeper levels (subagent) add ~one UI-label font size (`14px`) each.
  Worktree/archived group headers reuse the same folder chip chrome (hover wash + depth-1
  nest pad) so they share one vertical line with sibling folders; their direct sessions/folders
  keep that same depth so worktree items align with surrounding project items. Subsession
  expand chevrons align to the folder-icon column and stay hidden until row hover (unless
  always-show-actions). They render only when the session has loaded children or the
  persistent session index has confirmed that it has at least one child.
  Pinned rows stay flat: no subsession chevron and no nested children.
- Session rows are single-line (no inline timestamp); details (title, relative time, folder/project,
  branch) open in an immediate floating hover card (`delayDuration={0}`, top-left aligned).
- A session title button focused by an explicit mouse click enters inline rename
  on Enter. Keyboard or programmatic focus does not arm this shortcut, and blur
  clears the mouse-focus authorization.
- Compact relative times use `common.relative.*Compact` i18n keys.
- Row action icons (pin, archive/delete) use title-matched `h-3.5` glyphs with `gap-1` spacing; the title
  reserves right padding on hover so icons own their space — no fade veil behind them.
  The former three-dot overflow menu is a direct archive control; hold Shift to hard-delete
  (archived buckets always show delete). Rename/share/folder and other actions remain on the
  row context menu.
- Session busy/unread status is a trailing shrink-0 marker on the right of the title
  (ContextUsage-style track+arc ring while busy, info-colored unread dot when
  idle+unseen). It owns its own gutter so long titles truncate before it, and
  hides instantly on row hover (no opacity/padding transition) when hover/always-visible
  row actions take that edge.
- Archived groups are collapsed by default and support bulk deletion at group/folder level.
- Session rows support compact inline dates in minimal mode and simplified metadata in default mode.
- Session-row visual selection is published through a narrow row-only Focus store before authoritative navigation. Focus includes the render scope (`recent` or `project`) plus session/project identity, so duplicate representations never both receive the Active background or satisfy the wrong paint barrier.
- Previous/next-session navigation consumes ordered snapshots published from the rendered sidebar model. A Recent-origin focus cycles Recent items; a project-origin focus cycles only the logically visible rows inside its current expanded project. Rows hidden by project/group/folder collapse or the group's Show more boundary are excluded, while busy and retrying rows retained beyond that boundary remain keyboard targets. Shortcuts never cross into another project as a fallback.
- Advancing through Recent with the next-session shortcut reveals all remaining rows in the bounded 8-session Recent set, exactly like Show more. Navigation wraps after the eighth row and never loads another remote Recent page.
- Global Mod+1…9 navigation numbers the first nine logically visible session rows from top to bottom across Recent and the expanded project tree. Container headers never consume a number; duplicate Recent/Project representations remain distinct Focus rows. Holding the platform primary modifier for 500ms reveals compact shortcut chips only on those rows; each chip occupies only its intrinsic width and replaces row quick actions until release. Releasing the modifier, window blur, or page hide clears the hints immediately.
- Every session navigation announces a monotonic intent revision. A later sidebar, keyboard, deep-link, or switcher intent invalidates an older pending sidebar commit, including ABA sequences such as A -> B -> A.
- Project/group/folder ancestors are auto-expanded at most once for each navigation intent. Explicitly collapsing the project that owns the focused session remains respected during later hydration or persistence refreshes.
- Chat LRU visibility follows the authoritative selection synchronously: cache hits reveal the retained Activity immediately, while misses show an explicit skeleton. Constrained surfaces retain two 16 MiB views; geometry cache reuse keys on complete runtime, directory, and session identity; active-view estimates alone record cache size and trigger trimming. A newly rendered Activity enters the bounded LRU only after its DOM commit, so interrupted keyboard switches cannot evict a reusable view.
- New extractions in latest pass reduced local effect/callback bulk further:
  - project session list builders
  - folder cleanup sync
  - sticky project header observer

## VS Code grouping

- VS Code uses the **same grouped project tree** as web/desktop (project headers + folders + pinned-first ordering), not a separate flat list. Each open VS Code workspace folder is a project header.
- VS Code groups strictly **by open workspace**: `useSessionGrouping` funnels every non-archived session into the project's root group and emits **no per-worktree subgroups** (worktrees aren't registered in VS Code). `getSessionsForProject` buckets sessions to a workspace by exact directory match, so only sessions whose directory is an open workspace folder appear.
- VS Code passes `hideDirectoryControls` (clean workspace headers, no worktree/close chrome) and no longer passes `showOnlyMainWorkspace`/`sharedSessionsOnly`. Folders and pinning therefore work natively, scoped to the workspace root.

## File summaries

### Components

- `SidebarHeader.tsx`: Optional session-search field only (action toolbar removed).
- `SidebarDisplayModeMenu.tsx`: Display-mode equalizer menu; rendered on the first section title row.
- `SidebarPinnedSessions.tsx`: Global top section renderer for pinned sessions.
- `SidebarFooter.tsx`: Static footer with icon-only settings and shortcuts actions, plus optional update button.
- `SidebarProjectsList.tsx`: Main scrollable tree renderer for projects, root sessions, worktrees/groups, and empty/search states.
- `SessionGroupSection.tsx`: Renders a single worktree/archived group, collapse/expand, folder subtree, and group-level controls.
- `SessionNodeItem.tsx`: Renders one session row/tree node with inline metadata, menu actions, minimal/default variants, and nested children.
- `ConfirmDialogs.tsx`: Shared confirm dialog wrappers for session delete and folder delete flows.
- `sortableItems.tsx`: DnD sortable wrappers for project and group ordering plus project-row action affordances.
- `sessionFolderDnd.tsx`: Folder/session DnD scope and wrappers for dropping/moving sessions into folders.
- `sessionNavigationModel.ts`: Flattens the rendered project/group/folder model into ordered shortcut targets, then filters them against project/group/folder collapse and Show more state so project-scoped shortcuts use only logically visible rows.
- `sidebar-numbered-navigation.ts` (sync): Publishes the global first-nine visible session target order consumed by Mod+1…9, with revision-safe responsive remount cleanup.
- `sessionOwnership.ts`: Resolves session directories once into shared project/worktree ownership and folder-scope indexes.

### Hooks

- `hooks/useSessionActions.ts`: Centralizes session row actions (select/open, rename, share/unshare, archive/delete, confirmations).
- `hooks/useSessionSearchEffects.ts`: Handles search open/close UX and input focus behavior.
- Session bodies are loaded only for the selected session. The sidebar does not
  prefetch neighboring/recent session messages because those background pages
  compete with the active chat during cold start and rapid navigation.
- `hooks/useSessionGrouping.ts`: Builds grouped session structures and search text/filter helpers.
- `sessionTree.ts`: Pure parent/child forest builder for project grouping (pinned roots and their descendants omitted).
- `hooks/useSessionSidebarSections.ts`: Composes final per-project sections and group search metadata for rendering.
- `hooks/useProjectSessionSelection.ts`: Resolves active/current project-session selection logic and session-directory context.
- `hooks/useGroupOrdering.ts`: Applies persisted/custom group order with stable fallback ordering; archived groups are reorderable.
- `hooks/useArchivedAutoFolders.ts`: Maintains archived auto-folder structure and assignment behavior.
- `hooks/useSidebarPersistence.ts`: Persists sidebar UI state (expanded/collapsed/pinned/group order/active session) to storage + desktop settings.
- `hooks/useProjectRepoStatus.ts`: Tracks per-project git-repo state and root branch metadata.
- `hooks/useProjectSessionLists.ts`: Reads live and archived project buckets from the shared ownership index.
- `hooks/useSessionFolderCleanup.ts`: Cleans stale folder session IDs by reconciling known sessions/archived scopes.
- Persistent pinned, folder, and session-order cleanup consumes the store's complete-catalog ID snapshot (`fullCatalogSessionIds` + generation). Bounded directory snapshots only drive visible rows.
- Session order is keyed by each group's `folderScopeKey` and bound to the activity/member snapshot captured at drag time. Later activity or membership changes restore natural sorting; visual rows, navigation, and sortable items consume the same scope-local rule.
- `sessionSortableOrder.ts` derives visible sortable IDs and the shared scope-local comparator from the rendered folder tree, collapsed/search state, Show-more slice, and order activity snapshot. Reordering stays within one folder or the ungrouped scope; folder drops own cross-folder moves.
- `hooks/useStickyProjectHeaders.ts`: Tracks which project headers are sticky/stuck via `IntersectionObserver`.

### Types and utilities

- `types.ts`: Shared sidebar types (`SessionNode`, `SessionGroup`, summary/search metadata).
- `activitySections.ts`: Persisted top-section storage/helpers for the current `recent` session list.
- `sessionFocusReconciliation.ts`: Repairs the explicit Recent/Project focus identity after sidebar metadata or visibility changes without changing the authoritative current session.
- `utils.tsx`: Shared sidebar utilities (path normalization, sorting, dedupe, archived scope keys, project relation checks, text highlight, labels, compact/default date formatting, nest-indent padding helpers).
