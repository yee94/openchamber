 * materialize/merge: a lagging HTTP page omits tools SSE already admitted, or a
 * part map is briefly empty between commits. Those frames are unioned onto the
 * parts the UI last painted, keyed by part id and keeping the previous relative
 * position, so no row the user already saw disappears for a frame.
 *
 * This is the single owner of that invariant. Views must not re-derive it: a
 * render-time hold cannot tell a lagging page from a real delete, and holding
 * across renders makes a transient regression permanent.
 *
 * Trade-off, explicit: a genuine `message.part.removed` on a still-open
 * assistant is held until the turn settles. Aborts and errors stamp
 * `finish`/`error` on the message, which flips `allowsAuthoritativeShrink` and
 * releases the hold on the next commit.
 *
 * Completeness is held the same way, and unlike presence it is held even after
 * the turn settles: a projected part never replaces the full part it summarizes.
 * Detail only ever grows, so a live SSE part always outranks a projected page
 * regardless of arrival order.
